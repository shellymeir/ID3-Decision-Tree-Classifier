# ID3-Decision-Tree-Classifier
Implementation of decision tree classifier using the ID3 algorithm, with some other improvements such as knn.

The code was written as HW in the course "introduction to Artificial Intelligence" where we were given a train set, which was
a csv file in which each row described the symptoms of a patient and each column matched a specific symptom, to which we referred as feature
in order to build the classifier. 

We used KFold cross validation to assess the performance of our model and to make sure that it will generalize well to new, unseen data.
